# Regression Guardrail Catalog

## Purpose

Capture bugs, incidents, sign-off misses, and validation blind spots so future runs can catch them reliably.

## How to Use

Add an entry when a missed bug, incident, sign-off gap, repeated regression, or validation blind spot is discovered.

## Rules

- Not every regression updates product truth. Some regressions update sign-off workflow truth, testing truth, or operational guardrails only.
- Guardrails should be specific, repeatable, owned, and tied to validation.
- Markdown is the default guardrail catalog format. Add machine-readable representation only when the project has a clear consumer for it.
- Missed-by reasons and future guardrails should include evidence level when possible.

## Workflow

```txt
Incident / missed bug / sign-off gap discovered
  ->
Capture symptom
  ->
Capture missed-by reason
  ->
Define future guardrail
  ->
Record evidence paths
  ->
Update machine-readable catalog or catalog section
  ->
Refresh human workflow docs
  ->
Update wiki/context only if product truth changed
  ->
Run validation
```
