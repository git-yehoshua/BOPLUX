## Findings

- LOW runtime-skill-candidate-unknown-skill (.wwg/reports/runtime-skill-candidates.json): evidence=confirmed Candidate-only Runtime Skill Candidate id is unknown to the loaded Skill Registry. core.change-classifier is not present in the loaded Skill Registry. This remains warning-level while the record is candidate-only: WWG did not activate the skill, and Vorter owns any future runtime activation decision. Recommendation: Keep unknown IDs candidate-only unless they are intentionally added to the local registry; fail only if an unknown candidate claims active, approved, loaded, routed, or executed status.

- INFO ambiguous-report-classification: evidence=confirmed risk=low Some report-like files need human classification. Recommendation: Run `wwg reports --target .` and review the Ambiguous / Needs Review section.
- INFO generated-markers-balanced: Generated marker pairs are balanced where present.
- INFO gitignore-native-report-backups-missing (.gitignore): evidence=confirmed risk=low Report policy expects `.wwg/reports/backups/` to be ignored. Recommendation: Add a narrow ignore rule for `.wwg/reports/backups/` or `.wwg/.gitignore` `reports/backups/`.
